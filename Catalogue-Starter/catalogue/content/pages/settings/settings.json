    "site_description": "Idea Index is an evolving collection of open, experimental tools built to support creativity, productivity, and the everyday practice of making things. It sits at the intersection of design and development, offering small systems, prototypes, and platforms that invite people to work, think, and create in new ways. Rather than positioning itself as a polished software suite, Idea Index embraces curiosity, treating toolmaking as a form of research and craft. Each project is designed to be open, adaptable, and accessible, encouraging others to learn from it, extend it, or make something entirely new.",
